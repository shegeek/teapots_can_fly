This is the repo for the talk 
"Teapots Can Fly: 3D Graphics for Web Programmers"
by Kelley Nielsen kelleynnn@gmail.com
It can be found at https://github.com/shegeek/teapots_can_fly

To run the example, first clone the repo or unpack the zipball.
Then, you should be running some type of web server.
rls is a wrapper for the Python SimpleHTTPServer, so 
if you're on a *nix system, you may find it helpful.
Then, in your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8000.
You should see a blue or cyan teapot, against a white background,
moving from left to right over and over.
